      summary: Upload file V1
      security: []
      description: |
        ImageKit.io allows you to upload files directly from both the server-side and the client-side. For server-side uploads, [private API key authentication](/docs/api-reference/upload-file/upload-file#authorization-for-server-side-file-upload) is used. For client-side uploads, it is necessary to [generate a one-time token, signature, and expiration](/docs/api-reference/upload-file/upload-file#authorization-for-client-side-file-upload). The [V2 API](/docs/api-reference/upload-file/upload-file-v2) enhances security by verifying the entire payload using JWT.

        **File size limit** \
        On the free plan, the maximum upload file sizes are 20MB for images, audio, and raw files, and 100MB for videos. On the paid plan, these limits increase to 40MB for images, audio, and raw files, and 2GB for videos. These limits can be further increased with higher-tier plans.

        **Version limit** \
        A file can have a maximum of 100 versions.

        **Demo applications**

        - A full-fledged [upload widget using Uppy](https://github.com/imagekit-samples/uppy-uploader), supporting file selections from local storage, URL, Dropbox, Google Drive, Instagram, and more.
        - [Quick start guides](/docs/quick-start-guides) for various frameworks and technologies.

          description: >
            Authorization is different for server-side vs client-side file upload.

            ### Authorization for server-side file upload

            Basic HTTP authentication. Provide base64 encoded value of the string `your_private_api_key:`.

        
            Notice the colon (:) after the private key. It is required otherwise, authentication will fail. The format is `username:password`. `username` is your private key and `password` is an empty string.

        
            If you encode `your_private_api_key:` using base64, you will get `eW91cl9wcml2YXRlX2FwaV9rZXk6`.

            
            For example - `Authorization: Basic eW91cl9wcml2YXRlX2FwaV9rZXk6`

            ### Authorization for client-side file upload

            For client-side file upload, do not set `Authorization` header. 
            
            
            Instead pass `signature`, one-time `token` and `expire` as shown below.

            ### Authorization for client-side file upload
            
            For client-side file upload, do not set `Authorization` header. Instead your client-side application must pass a JSON Web Token (JWT) as an authentication parameter. The upload API expects a `token` as a parameter.

      description: |
        You can rename an already existing file in the media library using rename file API. This operation would rename all file versions of the file. 

        Note: The old URLs will stop working. The file/file version URLs cached on CDN will continue to work unless a purge is requested.

                    Special Characters: `.`, `_`, and `-`.

                    Option to purge cache for the old file URL.

                    When set to true, it will internally issue a purge cache request on CDN to remove cached content on the old URL. E.g. if an old file was accessible at - `https://ik.imagekit.io/demo/old-filename.jpg`, a purge cache request will be issued to remove the CDN cache for this URL. This purge request is counted against your monthly purge quota. 

                    Note: Cache will be purged only for the current version of file.

                    Default value - `false`

In case ImageKit is unable to download the file from the specified URL, a `400` error response is returned. This will also result in a `400` error if the file download request is aborted if response headers are not received in 8 seconds.

              - `binary` - You can send the content of the file as binary. This is used when a file is being uploaded from the browser.
              - `base64` - Base64 encoded string of file content.
              - `url` - URL of the file from where to download the content before uploading.
            
            Note: When passing a URL in the file parameter, please ensure that our servers can access the URL. In case ImageKit is unable to download the file from the specified URL, a `400` error response is returned. This will also result in a `400` error if the file download request is aborted if response headers are not received in 8 seconds.

            This is the client-generated JSON Web Token (JWT). The ImageKit.io server uses it to authenticate and check that the upload request parameters have not been tampered with after the token has been generated. Learn how to create the token on the page below.



            **Note**: Sending a JWT that has been used in the past will result in a validation error. Even if your previous request resulted in an error, you should always send a new token.



            **⚠️Warning**: JWT must be generated on the server-side because it is generated using your account's private API key. This field is required for authentication when uploading a file from the client-side.

      description: >-
        ImageKit API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in [the dashboard](https://imagekit.io/dashboard/developer/api-keys).

        
        Private keys have the prefix `private_` and the public keys have the prefix `public_`. Alternatively, you can use [restricted API keys](/docs/api-keys#restricted-api-keys) for granular permissions.

        
        Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

        
        Authentication to the API is performed via HTTP Basic Auth. Provide your API key as the basic auth username value. You do not need to provide a password.

        
        Send your HTTP requests with the `Authorization` header that contains the word Basic word followed by a space and a base64-encoded string username:password. 
        
        
        For example, if your private key is `private_rGAPQJbhBx`, encode `private_rGAPQJbhBx:` using base64. The encoded value will be `cHJpdmF0ZV9yR0FQUUpiaEJ4Og==`. Then send `Authorization: Basic cHJpdmF0ZV9yR0FQUUpiaEJ4Og==`.


        All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.
