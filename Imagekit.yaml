      description: |
        This API creates a new custom metadata field.

        Once a custom metadata field is created either through this API or using the dashboard UI, its value can be set on the assets. The value of a field for an asset can be set using the media library UI or programmatically through upload or update assets API.

                    Option to purge cache for the old file URL.

                    When set to true, it will internally issue a purge cache request on CDN to remove cached content on the old URL. E.g. if an old file was accessible at - `https://ik.imagekit.io/demo/old-filename.jpg`, a purge cache request will be issued to remove the CDN cache for this URL. This purge request is counted against your monthly purge quota. 

                    Note: Cache will be purged only for the current version of file.

                    Default value - `false`

                  description: |
                    This field accepts three kinds of values:

                    - `binary` - You can send the content of the file as binary. This is used when a file is being uploaded from the browser.
                    - `base64` - Base64 encoded string of file content.
                    - `url` - URL of the file from where to download the content before uploading.

                    Note: When passing a URL in the file parameter, please ensure that our servers can access the URL. In case ImageKit is unable to download the file from the specified URL, a 400 error response is returned. In addition to this, the file download request is aborted if response headers are not received in 8 seconds. This will also result in a `400` error.

                    The file name can contain:

                    - Alphanumeric Characters: `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9` (including unicode letters, marks, and numerals in other languages)
                    - Special Characters: `.` and `-`
                    Any other character including space will be replaced by `_`
                useUniqueFileName:
                  type: boolean
                  description: |
                    Whether to use a unique filename for this file or not.

                    - Accepts `true` or `false`.
                    - If set `true`, ImageKit.io will add a unique suffix to the filename parameter to get a unique filename.
                    - If set `false`, then the image is uploaded with the provided filename parameter, and any existing file with the same name is replaced.

                    Default value - `true`
                tags:

                  description: |
                    Set the tags while uploading the file.

                    - Comma-separated value of tags in the format `tag1,tag2,tag3`.
                    - The maximum length of all characters should not exceed 500.
                    - `%` is not allowed.
                    - If this field is not specified and the file is overwritten then the tags will be removed.
                  example: t-shirt,round-neck,men
                folder:
                  type: string
                  description: |
                    The folder path (e.g. `/images/folder/`) in which the image has to be uploaded. If the folder(s) didn't exist before, a new folder(s) is created. The nesting of folders can be at most 50 levels deep.

                    The folder name can contain:

                    - Alphanumeric Characters: `a-z` , `A-Z` , `0-9` (including unicode letters, marks, and numerals in other languages)
                    - Special Characters: `/` `_` and `-`
                    - Using multiple `/` creates a nested folder.

                    Default value - `/`
                isPrivateFile:
                  type: boolean
                  description: |
                    Whether to mark the file as private or not. This is only relevant for image type files.

                    - Accepts `true` or `false`.
                    - If set `true`, the file is marked as private which restricts access to the original image URL and unnamed image transformations without signed URLs. Without the signed URL, only named transformations work on private images

                    Default value - `false`
                customCoordinates:
                  type: string
                  description: |
                    Define an important area in the image. This is only relevant for image type files.

                    - To be passed as a string with the x and y coordinates of the top-left corner, and width and height of the area of interest in the format `x,y,width,height`. For example - `10,10,100,100`
                    - Can be used with `fo-custom` transformation.
                    - If this field is not specified and the file is overwritten, then customCoordinates will be removed.
                responseFields:
                  type: string
                  description: |
                    Comma-separated values of the fields that you want the API to return in the response. For example, set the value of this field to `tags,customCoordinates,isPrivateFile` to get the value of `tags`, `customCoordinates`, and `isPrivateFile` in the response. Accepts combination of `tags`, `customCoordinates`, `isPrivateFile`, `embeddedMetadata`, and `customMetadata`.

                overwriteAITags:
                  type: boolean
                  description: |
                    Default is `true`. If set to `true` and a file already exists at the exact location, its AITags will be removed. Set `overwriteAITags` to `false` to preserve `AITags`.

                  type: boolean
                  description: |
                    Default is `true`. If the request does not have `tags`, `overwriteTags` is set to `true` and a file already exists at the exact location, exiting `tags` will be removed. In case the request body has `tags`, setting `overwriteTag`s to `false` has no effect and request's tags are set on the asset.

                    This field accepts three kinds of values:

                    - `binary` - You can send the content of the file as binary. This is used when a file is being uploaded from the browser.
                    - `base64` - Base64 encoded string of file content.
                    - `url` - URL of the file from where to download the content before uploading.

                    Note: When passing a URL in the file parameter, please ensure that our servers can access the URL. In case ImageKit is unable to download the file from the specified URL, a 400 error response is returned. In addition to this, the file download request is aborted if response headers are not received in 8 seconds. This will also result in a `400` error.

                    The file name can contain:

                    - Alphanumeric Characters: `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9` (including unicode letters, marks, and numerals in other languages)
                    - Special Characters: `.` and `-`
                    Any other character including space will be replaced by `_`
                useUniqueFileName:
                  type: boolean
                  description: |
                    Whether to use a unique filename for this file or not.

                    - Accepts `true` or `false`.
                    - If set `true`, ImageKit.io will add a unique suffix to the filename parameter to get a unique filename.
                    - If set `false`, then the image is uploaded with the provided filename parameter, and any existing file with the same name is replaced.

                    Default value - `true`
                tags:

                  description: |
                    Set the tags while uploading the file.

                    - Comma-separated value of tags in the format `tag1,tag2,tag3`.
                    - The maximum length of all characters should not exceed 500.
                    - `%` is not allowed.
                    - If this field is not specified and the file is overwritten then the tags will be removed.

                    The folder path (e.g. `/images/folder/`) in which the image has to be uploaded. If the folder(s) didn't exist before, a new folder(s) is created. The nesting of folders can be at most 50 levels deep.

                    The folder name can contain:

                    - Alphanumeric Characters: `a-z` , `A-Z` , `0-9` (including unicode letters, marks, and numerals in other languages)
                    - Special Characters: `/` `_` and `-`
                    - Using multiple `/` creates a nested folder.

                    Whether to mark the file as private or not. This is only relevant for image type files.

                    - Accepts `true` or `false`.
                    - If set `true`, the file is marked as private which restricts access to the original image URL and unnamed image transformations without signed URLs. Without the signed URL, only named transformations work on private images

                    Default value - `false`
                customCoordinates:
                  type: string
                  description: |

                    - To be passed as a string with the x and y coordinates of the top-left corner, and width and height of the area of interest in the format `x,y,width,height`. For example - `10,10,100,100`
                    - Can be used with `fo-custom` transformation.
                    - If this field is not specified and the file is overwritten, then customCoordinates will be removed.
